# HOT TAKES #

## Installation ##
Clone this repo, run `npm install`.

## Usage ##

Run `npm start`. This should both run the local server and launch your browser.

If your browser fails to launch, or shows a 404 error, navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080.

Use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the local server.

If the app gives any problems you may have to run the server manually:

go in the backend folder and run nodemon server:

go in the frontend folder and run npm start.
